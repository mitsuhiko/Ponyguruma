Ponyguruma
  Oniguruma binding for Python

Ponyguruma was written for Python a few years back but it was
never uploaded to the Cheesehop.  I now (2011) moved the project
to github so that people can pick up on it.

What is Oniguruma?
  It's a regular expression engine that does a lot more than
  regular expressions and is known for being the regexp engine
  of choice for Ruby, TextMate and Sublime Text.

Why would I want to use it?
  For testing Oniguruma style regular expressions :-)

Is it fast?
  Not particularly, but that can be improved.

Who wrote it?
  Armin Ronacher and Georg Brandl.
